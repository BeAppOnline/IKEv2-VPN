# IKEv2 VPN Server Autot Setup Script
Setup your own Ikev2 / IPSec VPN Server in just a few minutes, with both IPSec/Ikev2 on Ubunto, Debian and CentOS. 
All you need to do is provide your own VPN domain and credentials, and let the scripts handle the rest.

An IPSec VPN encrypts your network traffic, so that no body between you and the VPN server can eavesdrop on your data as it travles via internet.
This is especially useful when using unsecured mnetworks, e.g. at coffee shops, airpots or hotel rooms.
